# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

```
mylist=[1,2,-8]
mysum=sum(mylist)
print(mysum)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program was executed successfully and the sum of all elements in the list was calculated using the built-in function.
